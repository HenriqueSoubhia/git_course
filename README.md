Congratulations on reaching the end of the first chapter! âœ¨

Here's a recap of everything we have learned in this chapter:

 - Creating a new repository on our local machine with git init.
 - Connecting our local repository to GitHub with git remote add.
 - Renaming our branch to main.
 - Staging and committing our changes with git add and git commit.
 - Checking the status of our files with git status.
 - Pushing our code to GitHub with git push.

Let's wrap up the chapter with something fun and creative! ðŸŽ‰
